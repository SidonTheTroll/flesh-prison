# Definition of Computer System
A computer system is an electronic system that accepts data (input), processes it according to a set of instructions (programs), stores it, and produces meaningful information (output).  
In simple words, a computer system is a combination of hardware and software that work together to perform tasks efficiently and accurately.

# Block Diagram of Computer System
A computer system mainly consists of the following units:
1. Input Unit
2. Central Processing Unit (CPU)
3. Memory Unit
4. Output Unit

## Explanation of Each Unit
1. **Input Unit:** The input unit is used to enter data and instructions into the computer. It converts human-readable data into machine-readable form. Examples: Keyboard, Mouse, Scanner, Microphone

2. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** The CPU is the brain of the computer. It performs all calculations, logical decisions, and controls the operations of the entire computer system. The CPU consists of:
    - Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU): Performs arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT, comparisons).
    - Control Unit (CU): Directs and coordinates all operations of the computer system. It controls the flow of data between memory, ALU, and input/output devices.
    - Registers: Small, high-speed memory locations inside the CPU used to store temporary data and instructions during processing.

3. **Memory Unit:** The memory unit stores data, instructions, and results. It plays a vital role in processing speed and efficiency. Memory is mainly classified into: 
    - **Primary Memory (Main Memory)**
        - Directly accessible by the CPU 
        - Fast but limited in capacity
        - Types of Primary Memory:
            - **RAM (Random Access Memory):** Volatile memory used to store data temporarily while the computer is running.
            - **ROM (Read Only Memory):** Non-volatile memory that stores permanent instructions such as booting programs.
    - **Secondary Memory (Auxiliary Memory)**
        - Used for long-term data storage
        - Non-volatile and larger in capacity
            - Examples: HDD, SSD, Pen Drive, CD/DVD

4. **Output Unit:** The output unit presents processed information in a human-readable form. Examples: Monitor, Printer, Speakers, Projector.

# Components of Computer System
A computer system has two major components:
1. Hardware
2. Software  

## Hardware Components
Hardware refers to the physical parts of a computer that can be seen and touched.
1. **Central Processing Unit (CPU):** it performs processing and control functions.

2. **Memory:** stores data and instructions required for processing. 

3. **Display Units:** Display units are output devices used to show information visually. Types of Display Units:
    - **CRT (Cathode Ray Tube):** Old type, bulky and consumes more power.
    - **LCD (Liquid Crystal Display):** Thin, lightweight, low power consumption. 
    - **LED (Light Emitting Diode):** Improved version of LCD with better brightness and efficiency

4. **Keyboard:** A keyboard is an input device used to enter text, numbers, and commands. Types of keys:
    - Alphanumeric keys
    - Function keys
    - Control keys
    - Numeric keypad

5. **Mouse:** A mouse is a pointing device used to select, drag, and interact with graphical elements on the screen.

6. **Hard Disk Drive (HDD)**:
    - Secondary storage device
    - Uses magnetic storage
    - Slower compared to SSD
    - Lower cost per GB

7. **Solid State Drive (SSD)**
    - Advanced secondary storage device
    - Uses flash memory
    - Faster data access
    - More durable and energy-efficient

8. **Other Peripheral Devices:** Scanner, Printer, Webcam, Microphone, Joystick, Speakers.

# Software
Software is a set of programs and instructions that tell the computer what to do. Software cannot be touched physically.

## Types of Software 
1. **Application Software**
    -Application software is designed to perform specific user-oriented tasks. Examples: MS Word, MS Excel, Web browsers, Media players, Accounting software. 

2. **System Software**
    - System software controls the operation of the computer hardware and provides a platform for running application software. Examples: Operating Systems, Device Drivers, Language Translators (Compiler, Interpreter)

3. **Utility Software**
    - Utility software is used for system maintenance and performance improvement. Examples: Antivirus software, Disk cleanup tools, Backup utilities, File compression tools

# Overview of Operating System (OS)
An Operating System (OS) is system software that acts as an interface between the user and computer hardware.

- **Functions of Operating System**
    - Process management
    - Memory management
    - File management
    - Device management
    - Security and access control
    - User interface management
