# Introduction to Environmental Sciences and Ecosystems 
- **Meaning of Environment:** the word environment is derived from the French word 'environ' meaning surrounding. 
- **Definition of EVS:** EVS is an interdisciplinary academic field that integrates physical, biological and information sciences (including geology, ecology, physics, chemistry and engineering, etc.) to study environmental problems and human impact on the environment. 
- **Elements of Environment:** 
    1. **Physical elements:** water bodies, rocks, climate, soils, space and landforms.
    2. **Biological Elements:** plants, animals, human beings and microorganisms. 
    3. **Cultural Elements:** economic, social, and political elements which are essential man-made features. 
    
- **Components of Environment:** 
    1. **Hydrosphere:** composed of all water bodies, e.g., ponds, lakes, seas, oceans, etc. 
    2. **Lithosphere:** refers to the outer solid layer of earth. Divided into three parts, i.e., crust, mantle, core. 
    3. **Biosphere:** refers to all living organisms on earth's surface and their interaction with water and air. It consists of plants, animals and microorganisms. 
    4. **Atmosphere:** consists of mixture of gases that protects the earth from harmful radiations of the sun. It is divided into 5 layers- troposphere, stratosphere, mesosphere, thermosphere and exosphere. 

## Scope of EVS 
1. To create awareness about various renewable and non-renewable resources. 
2. It provides necessary information about biodiversity richness and conservation of natural resources. 
3. It helps to understand the causes of natural and man-made disasters. 
4. It provides knowledge about environmental pollution control. 
5. It provides information about social issues in relation to environment and development. 

## Importance of EVS 
EVS has become significant for the following reasons. 

1. **Environmental issues of international importance:** Issues like global warming, ozone layer depletion, marine pollution are global issues that must be tackled with international efforts and cooperation. 
2. **Increase in pollution:** as world pollution is increasing at an alarming rate, it has led to exploitation of natural resources leading to pollution of all types.
