# Air, Noise and Radiation Pollution 
Pollution is the addition of certain harmful waste of air, water and soil by natural sources or certain human activities to such level of volume which adversely affect the quality of environment.  
That is, it is an undesirable change in the chemical, biological or physical structure of the environment, due to which harmful effect on the life of living beings occur.  
Any material that causes pollution of the environment are called pollutant. E.g., particulate matter, $CO_2$, $CH_4$, $H_2S$, $NO_2$, $CO$, $SO_2$. 

Pollutants are classified into two types- 

1. **Primary Pollutant:** these are emitted directly from identifiable sources. E.g., $SO_2$, $CO_2$, $NO_X$, hydrocarbons, etc. 
2. **Secondary Pollutant:** these are derived from primary pollutants by chemical reaction in the environment. E.g., primary pollutant like hydrocarbons and nitrogen oxides react in presence of sunlight to form peroxy acetyl nitrate (PAN) as secondary pollutant; $2SO_2 + O_2 \rightarrow 2SO_3,\ SO_3 + H_2O \rightarrow H_2SO_4$

## Air Pollution 
The presence of one or more contaminant in the atmosphere in large quantities for a duration of time so as to be injurious to any living being or which interferes with normal comfortable life is called air pollution. 

### Sources of Air Pollution 
1. **Natural Sources:** volcanic eruption, forest fire, biological decay, evaporation of volatile organic compounds. 
2. **Man-made Sources:** burning of petrochemicals, burning of gasoline in automobiles, thermal power plants, industrial processes.
