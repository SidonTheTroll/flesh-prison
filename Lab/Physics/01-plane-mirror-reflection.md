## Aim of the Experiment 
To verify the laws of reflection using a plane mirror and to study the image formed.

## Apparatus required 
Plane mirror with a support to hold it vertical, drawing board, sheet of white paper, protractor, measuring scale, pins, drawing pins, and adhesive tape. 

## Theory 
The laws of reflection are: 

1. The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal drawn at the point of incidence to the reflecting surface lie on the same plane. 
2. The angle of incidence $\angle i$ is equal to the angle of reflection, $\angle r$. A virtual image is formed by a plane mirror as per these laws of reflections. The virtual image formed is as far behind the mirror as it is in front of it, i.e., object distance = image distance. 

## Procedure 
1. A white sheet of paper is fixed on the drawing board using either adhesive tape or drawing pins. 
2. A thin line SS' is drawn in the middle of the paper, also a normal ON is drawn to the line SS' at point O. 
3. A thin line PO is drawn at any angle to the line SS'. The mirror is placed vertically on the line SS' with the help of a support so that its polished surface faces line PO. 
4. Vertically two pins $P_1$ and $P_2$ are fixed with their tips separated by a suitable distance of about 5 to 6 cm at two points on the line PO. The image $P_1'$ and $P_2'$ it is observed whether, that is looked from the same side of the plane mirror. 
5. Two pins $P_3$ and $P_4$ are fixed vertically such that their feet appear to be in the same straight line as that of image $P_1'$ and $P_2'$ it is observed whether the feet of the images, as seem in the mirror appear to be on the same straight line. If it is so, you have correctly fixed the pins $P_3$ and $P_4$.
6. All the pins and the mirror are removed. The positions of the feet of pins $P_3$ and $P_4$ are marked. A thin line OQ are drawn joining the points that mark the position of feet of pins $P_3$ and $P_4$. Also this line is extended till it meets the line SS'. This extended line should meet the surface SS' at the point O. The line OQ shows the path of the reflected ray corresponding to the incident ray along the line PO, at the point of incidence. 
7. The angles (PON), $(\angle i)$ and (NOQ), $(\angle r)$ are measured and the value are recorded in observation table. 
8. The experiment is repeated for two more angles of incidence. 

## Observation 
| No. of Obs. | Angle of incidence, $\angle i$ | Angle of reflection, $\angle  r$ | Difference $\angle i - \angle r$ | 
| 1. | $30\degree$ | $30\degree$ | $0\degree$ |
| 2. | $50\degree$ | $50\degree$ | $0\degree$ |
| 3. | $66\degree$ | $66\degree$ | $0\degree$ |

## Result 
Here the reflected ray meets the point of incidence for all angles of incidence. The reflected ray lie in the plane of incidence. 

The angle of incidence, $\angle i$ = $30\degree ,\ 50\degree ,\ 66\degree$
The angle of reflection, $\angle i$ = $30\degree ,\ 50\degree ,\ 66\degree$

As $\angle i = \angle r$ and the incident ray, normal and the reflected ray lie in the same plane, laws of reflection are verified.  
A virtual, erect and equal in size to the object is formed by the plane mirror under reflections. 

## Precautions 
1. The plane mirror must be placed vertically on the plane of the paper. 
2. The mirror should be made of thin glass with smooth surface. Else multiple images would be formed.
