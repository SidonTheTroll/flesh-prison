## Aim of the Experiment 
To verify the laws of reflection using a plane mirror and to study the image formed.

## Apparatus required 
Plane mirror with a support to hold it vertical, drawing board, sheet of white paper, protractor, measuring scale, pins, drawing pins, and adhesive tape. 

## Theory 
The laws of reflection are: 

1. The incident ray, the reflected ray and the normal drawn at the point of incidence to the reflecting surface lie on the same plane. 
2. The angle of incidence $\angle i$ is equal to the angle of reflection, $\angle r$. A virtual image is formed by a plane mirror as per these laws of reflections. The virtual image formed is as far behind the mirror as it is in front of it, i.e., object distance = image distance. 

## Observation 
| No. of Obs. | Angle of incidence, $\angle i$ | Angle of reflection, $\angle  r$ | Difference $\angle i - \angle r$ | 
| 1. | $30\degree$ | $30\degree$ | $0\degree$ |
| 2. | $50\degree$ | $50\degree$ | $0\degree$ |
| 3. | $66\degree$ | $66\degree$ | $0\degree$ |

## Result 
Here the reflected ray meets the point of incidence for all angles of incidence. The reflected ray lie in the plane of incidence. 

The angle of incidence, $\angle i$ = $30\degree ,\ 50\degree ,\ 66\degree$
The angle of reflection, $\angle i$ = $30\degree ,\ 50\degree ,\ 66\degree$

As $\angle i = \angle r$ and the incident ray, normal and the reflected ray lie in the same plane, laws of reflection are verified.  
A virtual, erect and equal in size to the object is formed by the plane mirror under reflections. 

## Precautions 
1. The plane mirror must be placed vertically on the plane of the paper. 
2. The mirror should be made of thin glass with smooth surface. Else multiple images would be formed.
